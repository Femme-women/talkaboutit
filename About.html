<h1 class="h1au">OUR STORY</h1>
<h2 class="h2au">About us</h2>
<br>
<p class="paragraph">I am a high school student aiming to make a difference in today’s world. 
  Growing up, I saw multiple women around me get exposed to all kinds of health issues. I have seen my own mother 
  battle against endometriosis and I have grown up around multiple strong women who have fought against cancer. 
  What made me unhappy was that these women not only had to struggle with the impacts of the disease on their body 
  but also the societal view of these diseases. Most people they came across didn’t know what the disease was or had 
  unmodernized opinions on the diseases. There were societal stigmas surrounding these health issues impacting the mental 
  health of these women. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="paragraph">I realized that multiple health problems such as breast cancer, ovarian and cervical cancer, 
      any gynecological issues, pregnancy issues, common autoimmune diseases and many others are very common but due 
      to this extent of lack of awareness, many women do not know if they are facing it or when to reach out for help.  
      The main cause I identified for the problem of society's view on common women’s issues is the lack of awareness 
      and social stigma. Women could be scared or embarrassed of having these issues due to either the side effects they 
      are facing or the social stigma surrounding the issue. Women who are confident and can share their issues openly 
      find the problem of lack of awareness. It takes a lot of courage to open up about these issues and realizing that 
      people do not even know about the existence of this issue may have an impact on the courage.
